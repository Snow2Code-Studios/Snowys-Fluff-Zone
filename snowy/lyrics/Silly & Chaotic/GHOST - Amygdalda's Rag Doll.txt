I hide, I hide in iodine words
It's something inexplicable
It's something unaccountable
I cry, I cry when anything hurts Vexatious, my amygdala
That I can't do a thing about
The tricks and trivials of
Every twenty four
Maybe you can tone it down
A little more
And I, and I dunno
Oh, all I ever knew before
Were clusters of holes
An eye for an eye
That's how the game works
I'm losing my autonomy
A mutilated part of me
And I defy the way the game works
Between you and me
It's only getting worse
For the mouth
Of a cauterized rag doll
Supplications to leave him alone
For the mouth
Of a cauterized rag doll
Throw the nails away
And leave him alone
I don't know
Where the thoughts are coming from
Pull my strings
And swallow ichor
Fire burns
And the rags are torn apart
I can't inhale anymore
'Cuz all I've ever known are holes
Today something changed
I figured it's true
The frontal lobe placed me
Behind my own strings
'Cuz I, defy, the way the game works
I'll say it again
I'm only getting worse
The dull assumptions
That I've tasted decency
To lose their glow
And I, and I dunno
Oh, all I've ever seen before
Were clusters of holes
Waiting for the world to burn
Waiting for the holes to close now
Waiting for the world to burn
Waiting for the holes to close now
I can't see
The holes in my memories
The fire and I, alone again
The guilt and I, alone again
Say we take what had been torn apart
Say we mend any patchwork discord
Turning eyes to the Trypo-Puppeteer
I can't exhale anymore
So, one, two, three
And we'll tie the tourniquet
Pull my skin and swallow inchor
Fire burns
And the rags are torn apart
I can't inhale anymore
Day by day and day after day
I'm causing trouble anyway
Pull the fire alarm
I never meant any harm
Never meant any harm
Well, say my limbs are torn apart
And all the suffering falls apart
Let the toy wind down
It should've never been wound
I never meant any harm
Say we take what had been torn apart
Say we mend any patchwork discord
Turning eyes to the Trypo-Puppeteer
Waiting for the world to burn
So, one, two, three
And we'll tie the tourniquet
Larvae eating away at everything
Word goes 'round
I'm the Trypo-Puppeteer
Laugh along, I'm spreading holes
Now I know
This has always been my fault
And I can't inhale anymore
