                                Snowy's origins are wrapped in mystery, as elusive as the stars themselves. Though they have been part of the Furry Fandom for some time, even Snowy doesn’t know when they first got involved. This adds to their air of intrigue, especially since they prefer to go by "Snow," "Snowy," or "Lyn Snow," avoiding their birth name altogether. Snowy's love for cats has always been a core part of their identity—cats are their quiet companions, and Snowy finds joy in their calming presence.

                                Snowy cleans himself in two ways:
                                
                                <br><br>Like a cat: By licking. This method is effective, but because of Snowy's ADHD, they often overdo it until their fluff is entirely wet. During this time, Snowy doesn’t look fluffy at all.
                                <br>With baths: While effective, baths often leave Snowy’s fluff wet for extended periods, even after attempting to dry off.

                                From an early age, Snowy was diagnosed with ADHD. However, it is now believed this may have been a misdiagnosis, as Snowy does not exhibit typical ADHD symptoms. Instead, it seems more likely that Snowy is autistic. Known for being fluffy, cute, and full of energy, Snowy's introverted and shy nature often leads them to prefer solitude, both in real life and in gaming. While they enjoy alone time, Snowy dislikes complete isolation, seeking an escape from overwhelming crowds. Their love of technology and computers provides both a creative outlet and a comforting space, where Snowy can immerse themselves in programming and tech, finding joy in solving complex problems and creating new things.

                                Snowy identifies as aroace (aromantic and asexual), which shapes how they view relationships and connections with others. This part of their identity means they value deep, meaningful friendships and companionship over traditional romance. Snowy doesn't feel romantic attraction but expresses love and affection in their own unique ways, especially through actions rather than words. Their relationships are rooted in mutual trust and respect, allowing them to connect deeply with people like Cone, their romantic partner.

                                While Snowy is affectionate with those they trust, they are particular about personal space. Snowy prefers people other than Cone to ask before doing anything that involves touching their tail, body, or nose. This includes head pats, boops, hugs, or petting. With Cone, these gestures bring comfort and grounding, but with others, Snowy values the respect of being asked first. Snowy appreciates physical affection but prefers to keep it within comfortable boundaries unless explicitly invited.
    
                                <br><br>Snowy also dislikes being picked up without permission and would prefer if people asked first. This boundary is part of their need to feel in control of their space and body.

                                Snowy can be flustered at times, whether it’s with friends like Fox and Derp, or even Cone, their romantic partner. This flustered nature adds to Snowy's innocent charm, but at times, they are completely unfazed by things that might embarrass others. Snowy is easily confused too, especially when faced with tricky questions or situations they can’t immediately grasp. Whether it’s playful teasing from friends or a moment that catches them off-guard, Snowy’s reactions are always endearing, even if they don’t always understand what’s going on right away.

                                                <br><br><br>Snowy has struggled with depression since 2021, facing internal battles they rarely share openly. They often feel like no one truly cares about their mental health struggles—until emotions, particularly anger, bubble to the surface. Snowy is known to say, "Nobody cares about your mental health until it turns into anger. Then everyone sees you as the problem."
            
                                                <br><br>During depressive or suicidal episodes, Snowy may express thoughts such as:

                                                <br>"My name is better on a gravestone."
                                                <br>"A bullet would look good in my head."
            
                                                <br><br>These phrases reflect the deep emotional pain Snowy feels in these moments. They are a cry for help, but Snowy often struggles to reach out to others for support, leaving them trapped in their own mind. This feeling is reflected in the depressing quotes that Snowy keeps saved on their phone’s SD card, acting as a reminder of the battle they face.

                                Snowy copes with emotional pain through various methods, some healthy and some destructive. On bad days, they may turn to self-inflicted harm, with scars hidden beneath their snow-white fluff, and only visible if you stroke their fur the right way. These self-inflicted wounds are a visual manifestation of their internal turmoil. On better days, Snowy engages in healthier coping mechanisms, such as working on technology projects, spending time with their pets, or retreating into the comfort of music and gaming.

                                Snowy has severe trust issues, making it difficult for them to trust anyone new. When yelled at, Snowy may cry, release their anger, or do both simultaneously. They keep their feelings and pain inside, thinking no one will care. Snowy believes, "Nobody cares about your mental health until it turns into anger. Then everyone sees you as a problem."
                        
                                <br><br>When depressed or upset, Snowy often goes quiet. They overthink everything, struggle with maintaining eye contact, and feel like they aren’t good at anything, including being a friend. However, once Snowy is comfortable with someone, they can become more talkative, wild, and fun.

                                        Though Snowy tries to keep their feelings hidden, even from close friends like Fox, and Derp, there are moments when their pain becomes too much to bear. During depressive or suicidal episodes, they may isolate themselves, retreating to quiet places, where their love of cats and quiet hobbies like tinkering with technology help them find peace. While they are convincing with a forced smile around acquaintances, Cone always sees through their facade. The fear of losing anyone close—especially Cone—drives Snowy’s deep-seated emotional turmoil.

                                            Snowy’s love for Cone blossomed in 2024, marking the start of a beautiful relationship. Though shy and unable to openly flirt, their relationship is full of deep affection. Sometimes they nervously say things like, "You own me :3" or "I give you my full permission to do whatever you want to me," though these moments are rare due to Snowy's reserved nature. Cone’s physical gestures—pats, boops, and hugs—bring Snowy comfort and grounding, especially during moments of emotional turmoil. Even though Snowy often appears distant or unengaged, this is sometimes a reflection of their struggles rather than a lack of care. Snowy needs reassurance, even when they don’t ask for it outright, and finds solace in Cone’s affection.

                                        Snowy’s body hides many secrets beneath its snow-white fluff. Their appearance often shifts depending on their emotional state, but their fur is usually a pure snow-white, though it sometimes changes. On rare occasions, their fur can take on dark green hues, but this isn’t often seen. More commonly, their pristine coat becomes stained with streaks of red—a haunting symbol of self-inflicted harm and emotional turmoil. These red marks appear far more frequently than the green, acting as a visual reminder of Snowy’s internal struggles.

Only those close enough to stroke their fur in certain ways might uncover these wounds. The most visible scar is the one given by Cone, the mark from a bite that zombified Snowy, symbolizing their deep connection with Cone. On Snowy's good days, their fur remains untouched and snow-white, a symbol of their resilience and calm.

However, despite its cozy appearance, Snowy still tends to feel cold at times. When annoyed, Snowy isn't afraid to use their tail as a weapon, giving a good whack to anyone who gets on their nerves. Despite this, Snowy is still trying (and failing) to catch their own tail in their paws, constantly questioning whether it's as fluffy as it looks.

Snowy loves creating harmless chaos, always respecting boundaries—especially Cone’s. Their playful nature also includes a deep love for all things related to computers and technology. Snowy enjoys building, repairing, and coding, finding joy in understanding how machines and systems work.

                                Snowy is Non-Binary, Aroace, Grey Asexual, and Grey Aromantic. While Snowy identifies as a boy, they are fine with any pronouns, including she/her. Snowy once considered transitioning (male to female) but ultimately decided it wasn’t for them. This fluidity in identity reflects their openness and self-awareness.

                                Snowy is immersed in the Furry Fandom, but they are not a fursona—they are their true self. However, Snowy has fursonas they use in different contexts, including:

                                <br>Pixel Fur – A tuxedo cat (female), who loves digital art and peaceful surroundings.
                                <br>Terabyte – An orange female protogen, known for her creativity and strong will.
                                <br>Perabyte – A green male protogen, often seen as a protector figure.
                                <br>Gibibyte - A mysterious protogen.
                                <!-- <br>Snow Blossom – An arctic fox with no gender, reflecting Snowy's more neutral or non-binary aspects. -->
                                <br><br>These fursonas allow Snowy to express different sides of their personality, each offering a unique lens through which they view and interact with the world.
                                    
                                <br><br>
                                A while after meeting Fox, Derply, and Cone in Team Fortress 2: Zombie Escape, Snowy attempted to leave the Furry Fandom. However, like many have joked, 'You can never leave the Furry Fandom.' This attempt was short-lived, and Snowy returned, more invested than ever.

                                Snowy has a playful and chaotic side. One anecdote involves being "trapped" in their friend Fox’s basement for weeks, unable to keep track of time. This chaotic energy reflects Snowy’s love for humor and silliness.

                                Snowy has picked up bits of various languages, knowing a few basic words in Russian (e.g., 'Спасибо,' 'да,' 'мяукать'), Polish (e.g., 'nie,' 'tak,' 'miauczeć'), Spanish (e.g., 'sí,' 'cono,' 'maullar'), and German (e.g., 'ja,' 'nein,' 'miau'). Their language knowledge is a mix of useful and playful words, reflecting their love of curiosity and quirky interests.

                                Snowy often makes playful and outlandish claims, like having a magic spell they could use to zombify someone—or even everyone—at any time. There’s no proof that this spell actually works, adding an element of mystery and humor to Snowy’s personality.

                                One of the biggest mysteries surrounding Snowy is how they first entered the Furry Fandom. Snowy often reflects on this as a defining yet enigmatic part of their identity.

                                Snowy’s hearing can often go in and out—sometimes they may go deaf for a few moments, a phenomenon that happens at random intervals. This temporary deafness is an additional sensory quirk that adds to their complex experiences with ADHD and other sensory sensitivities.

                                        Though shy about flirting, Snowy expresses their love for Cone in other ways. They often say things like, "Your love is more than money could ever buy," or "You mean the world to me <3." Snowy may not always find the words to fully express their feelings, but their actions speak louder than words.
