                            Let me introduce you to my main OC, Snowy.<br>
							She is female.<br>
							She prefers to go by Snow or Snowy, but is fine being called anything else.<br><b>But only from the ones she trusts.</b><br><br>
							She likes cats<br>
							She likes snow (obviously)<br>
							She likes blood (for some reason)<br>
                            In her past, she used to be a thief, but her thieving activities were minimal and had little impact.<br>
							She identifies with various gender and sexual identities, including Non-Binary, Aroace, Grey Asexual, Grey Aromantic, and Pansexual, which means she experiences these identities in a unique way.<br>
							
							She is fine with any pronouns, including ones that aren't normally used for her gender.<br>
							She had went through a Femboy Phase, but this ended in December 2024.<br>
							She has a meowing and hissing habit.<br>
							She lives in the UK, and has visited Spain for a week.<br> <!-- real -->
							She hates antifurs and Zoophiles.<br>
							She is totally silly >_<<br>

							<br><br>She has some boundaries, you can see them <a href="/pages/about/snowy/lore.html?showloresec=Snowys_Boundaries">here.</a><br><br>
							<br><br>
							Her native language is one she made herself, Bottom Language.<br>Noone knows what she says in her native language besides one person and herself.<br><br>
							Despite her native language being Bottom and not being able to communicate in English well, she still has some basic understanding of other languages.
